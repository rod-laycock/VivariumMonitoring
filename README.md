# VivariumMonitoring

## Introduction

I have 3 ball pythons and I need to ensure they are temperature regulated, too hot and they will not thrive, too cold and they will sleep and eventually die through not eating.

## Plan
Create a temperature monitoring system which can monitor all the vivariums, which I can check on a local website using a browser.

I will also need an colour coded LED to inform me if there is an issue.
